# CoolChat

CoolChat is the coolest spot to chat!
Make sure to put on some sunglasses before you connect and start yapping! (background is really white)

# How to run:

1. Make sure you have docker 27.1 installed!

2. In the root directory of the project, run:
```docker compose up -d```

This will spin up all the containers and they should connect automatically (unless some of their preconfigured ports are in use by the host machine)

The preconfigured ports are:
    - Frontend : 8000
    - Backend  : 1337

# How to chat!

You can use these user creds to log-in:
- user:'bob', password:'root'
- user:'alice', password:'root'

Now you should be able to chat in two different browsers!

(There is no limit to how many times a user can be logged in, do with that information what you will)

Have fun!
