Make sure you have docker 27.1 installed!


In the root directory of the project, run:
```docker compose up -d```

This will spin up all the containers and they should connect automatically (unless some of their preconfigured ports are in use by the host machine)

The preconfigured ports are:
    - Frontend : 8000
    - Backend  : 1337
